# THE KEY FEATURES

Databazel <b>natively</b> connects to MongoDB and present the results in a visual dashboard reporting interface, without requiring any additional development on your end.

<b>No ETL</b>. We believe you should keep data where it is and use tools that are smart enough to visualize data directly from MongoDB without building ETL.

Our solution is <b>completely web-based</b> so all you need to get started is a web browser!

<b>Real-time</b> analytics for your database.

You <b>can share</b> the created charts with your teammates.
